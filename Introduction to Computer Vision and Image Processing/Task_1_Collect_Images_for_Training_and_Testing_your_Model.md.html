    <h3>Task 1: Collect Images for Training and Testing your Model</h3>
    <p>In order to train your Visual Recognition Classifier, you need to gather datasets of images for people wearing Helmet or No-helmet. Collecting the right and diversified data is a very important component for building a good vision recognition model. To help you in finding the images, we are proposing the following sources and you can search for more sources.</p>
    <p>Google</p>
    <p>Kaggle</p>
    <p>Github</p>
    <p>Unsplash</p>
    <p>During your image collection process, we recommend you:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Collect at least 160 images for each set of labels (that is 160 for Helmet, 160 for No-helmet)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Ensure you have a diverse set of images in your dataset. For example:</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
      <li>Different colors of Helmets (White, Orange, Red,...)</li>
      <li>Different camera angles of the people wearing Helmet (from the sides, back, and front)</li>
      <li>Different times of day ( night, sunny,...)</li>
    </ul>
    <ol start="3">
      <li>
        <p>Keep around 5% (approx. 10 per label) of the collected images for testing the model</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>For the remainder, 95% of the images (that is, about 150 per label) that will be used for training the model, create two different ".zip" files. Call them Helmet.zip and No-helmet, respectively. This will make it easy for drag-and-drop into Watson Visual Recognition.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Proceed to the next Task, once you have gathered and saved sufficient number of images and saved then in the zip files as indicated above.</p>
